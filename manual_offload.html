    <h1 class="top">Manual for Remote Operation of the Irregular Telegraph</h1>
    <blockquote>This document is provided in collaboration with the Irregular Operations Line Service (IOLS) under clause of the Remote Freight Operation Act. Use for any other purpose is prohibited.</blockquote>

    <h1 class="colored">STATIONARY - MANAGING</h1>
    <p>This document covers how to offload wares at stations, and advanced upgrades.<br>The following commands are for use while the train is at a station.
    <br><a href="manual.html">Back to Front Page.</a></p>
    
    <h1>5. Offloading Wares</h1>
    <p>Finally, once the order has been filled and is ready, you can offload the wares for the order at the appropriate station. 
    This is done with the following command:</p>
    
    <blockquote> /station offload_order [orderslip ID] [ware] </blockquote>
    
    <p>Please refer to the order for the appropriate wares to offload.<br>Offloading wares requires an active order AND an orderslip to be filled out and present in your inventory, as well as the ware.
        <br>
        The orderslip ID is identical to the Order ID.<br></p>
        <p>Upon offloading, the orderslip will be inspected by customs. If all seems in order, it will be sent to the local courier service and transported to the recipient address. If all information on the Orderslip was correct, you will be paid the reward. If there are any issues, you will be forced to pay fines or fees.
    </p>
    
    
    
    <h1>6. Advanced Upgrades</h1>
    <p>While you will be equipped with all necessary functionality for train operation, it is possible for you to upgrade your capabilities for a fee.<br>As this is a /station command, upgrades can only be viewed and purchased at stations.<br>
        See the possible upgrades with the following command:</p>
    
    <blockquote>/station upgrade</blockquote>
    
    <p>Upgrades are purchased using the same command, followed by an argument:</p>
    
    <blockquote>/station upgrade [name]</blockquote>
    
    <p>The [name] can either be the full name or the 3-letter Upgrade Code listed beside it.</p>
    <p>Some upgrades are self-explanatory and will not be explained here, yet some require some deeper explanations and are covered below.</p>
    
    
    <h3 id="-6-1-the-internal-database-uid-"><strong>6.1 Upgrade: The Internal Database (UID)</strong></h3>
    
    <p>As a certified RIT Unit Operator, you can gain access to an internally updatable database of addresses. This database is malleable and updated by you and your fellow operators. Proper maintenance of this database will allow easy rediscovery of addresses discovered previously, or you may find a fellow operator has already found what you are searching for.</p>
    <p>Usage of this is entirely optional and the internal database is only useful if you know the name of the recipient.</p>
    <p>The following command allows adding a new address to the database:</p>
    
    <blockquote>/query internalstorage [name] [address] </blockquote>
    
    <p>The name database will be checked against all existing names in all databases, to ensure you are not adding fake data.<br>You can also update existing information with the same command, using the name and the new address.<br>Querying this database in the future (see <a href="manual_query.html">Section 3.b.5</a>) will output information in the following format:</p>
    <pre><code class="lang-c">ID|<span class="hljs-string">Name :</span> Address (Last <span class="hljs-string">edited:</span> Timestamp)
    </code></pre>
    <p>The ID is useful for easy filling of order slips and reporting corrosion. Refer to <a href="manual_query.html">Section 4.a</a>, and 6.2.</p>
    <p>Beware, due to natural data decomposition, this database too can become corrupted if the entry has not been under proper maintenance. Refer to the timestamp when making your judgment of its veracity. As with all databases, older entries should be considered candidates for decorrosion.</p>
    
    <p><strong>6.1a Using Addresses in the Internal Database for Orderslips</strong></p>
    <p>Advanced use of the /fillorder command allows inputting the UC ID of the person stored in the internal address database into the address field when typing the command. Upon sending the /fillorder command, the internal database will be cross-referenced if a UC ID is present  in the address field, and if successful, the address will be filled in. You can refer to the command window to confirm.</p>
    
    <h3 id="6-2-corrosion-reporting-ucr-">6.2 Corrosion Reporting (UCR)</h3>
    <p>As per the nature of corroded databases, you might find an address impossible to conclusively ascertain from the databases. In this case, you can report it for corrosion repair at a local decorrosion provider. (Note: this is different from sending an order to a decorrosion provider, this is a more long-term solution that affects the database itself, rather than just the order).</p>
    <p>This is done through the following command:</p>
    
    <blockquote>/query report [id] [(optional) name]</blockquote>
    
    <p>Upon successfully reporting, this command will create an entry in the internal database (see 6.1) (This upgrade thus requires The Internal Database).<br>The address will in this case be marked for decorrosion. It is also possible to use this information for easy filling of orderslips same as the regular internal database. See 6.1a for information on how to do this. Note that while this has been filled, it will take a Decorrosion Provider some time to update the database information.<br>
        You may optionally provide a name if you have determined it, and it will be stored in the entry as well. If not, it will automatically be filled in with the value “For Decorrosion Provider”</p>
    <p>While we cannot guarantee when a Decorrosion Provider will look at the internal database, but usually it takes around 6-8 hours from report to successful decorrosion. You should get a message once the decorrosion has been successfully completed.</p>
    <p>The Connective Rail Company thanks you for doing this service to improve decorrosion in our data.</p>
    

    <h1>7. Administration</h1>
    <p>You may wish to cease your activities as Operators for the CRC. The following section will clarify how this is done.</p>

    <h3><strong>7.1 Temporarily Pausing and Resuming Activities</strong></h3>
    <p>You may find yourself unable to engage properly in Operator activity for a period of time. If so, you may pause the connection to the telegarph with the following command:</p>
    <blockquote>/pause</blockquote>

    <p>Note, the train will still continue to move. The Train Must Leave. If you have any outstanding orders that are not delivered, they will likely expire (although, this will not incur a monetary penalty)</p>

    <p>When you wish to resume activities once again, use the following command:</p>
    <blockquote>/resume</blockquote>

    <h3><strong>7.2 Resigning</strong></h3>
    <p>You may wish to resign from your duties as CRC Operators permanently. Use the following command:</p>
    <blockquote>/resign</blockquote>
    <p>This action is <b>permanent and cannot be undone</b>. If you wish to become a CRC Operator again, you need to use the <a href="manual.html">/startoperation</a> command to begin anew.</p>
