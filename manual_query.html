    <h1 class="coloredgreen">TRAVEL - INVESTIGATING</h1>
    <p>This document covers how to query databases to find recipient information, and how to fill that information into orderslips.<br>Querying is only possible while the train is traveling.
    <br><a href="manual.html">Back to Front Page.</a></p>
    
    <h1>3. Finding Recipient Information</h1>
    <p>To be able to fulfill the order, you will need <b>the home address</b> and <b>name</b> of the order recipient. This is required for completion of the order slip. <br>
    
        Every order contains a UC ID of the recipient that you will use as the starting point to find this information. Use the following command:</p>
    <blockquote>/query database [entry to query] [database key] [public]</blockquote>
    <p>Description of the arguments:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The “entry to query” must be exact to specifications. This is either the name of a person or an address.</li>
        <li>Database key is the name of the database. See below of possible databases.</li>
        <li>“Public” is whether the result should be visible to other fellow Operators. Defaults to True if not provided.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Databases will likely return multiple possible results for any query. Existent database decomposition leaves individual databases incomplete and untrustworthy.<br>
    
        Thus, in most cases, you will need to use multiple databases to determine the exact address or name of any recipient. It is up to you to determine the best method for this.</p>
    
    <p>The databases you have access to are below, listed by what type of data they accept.<br>
    If you are unsure where to start, start with the “person” database and use the information in there to find the Name and the Home Address of the recipient.<br>
    See section 3.1 if you are unable to ascertain this information.</p>
    
    <h3>3.a Databases Accepting Person IDs</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Personal Register</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li><i>The official UC Person Identification Database</i></li>
            <li>database key: <strong>"person"</strong></li>
            <li>Expects the ID of a person (An ID has the format 123-456). Outputs all known information about the person in the following order:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Name</li>
                    <li>Job</li>
                    <li>Work Address</li>

                </ol>
            <li>These may have No Entry. Use this to inform your future queries. This database is kept clean and any corrupted entry is deleted. Thus if this database has information, you can consider it trustworthy.</li>
            <li>Note: You may be fortunate that this database includes both the name and the home address. In this case you will not need to consult any other databases and can proceed to Step 4.</li>

    <p>Once you have determined the necessary information for an Orderslip with reasonable accuracy, you can move on to 4.</p>
    <p><strong>3.1 Corrosion</strong> <br>
        It may be impossible to determine the name or address of a recipient in some difficult cases due to the natural database corrosion. If this happens, you may proceed and consult Step 4.a</p>
    
    <p><strong>3.2 Threading</strong> <br>
        Any query provided in a channel will divert into a thread. This is for ease of use when using multiple queries to find the necessary information for one recipient. You may provide additional queries inside the thread, for organization.</p>
    <p><strong>3.3 Vacancy</strong> <br>
    Outside of being marked as empty in the Address information (see Section 3.c.1), an address can also be marked as vacant through its tenant being named “<strong>V. Vacant</strong>”. This is an legacy marking of Vacancy still used by the Estate Census. Any entry with this should be considered a vacant address at the time of reporting (yet of course, this may be corroded data and should be treated as no different than other information).</p>
    
    
    <h1>4. Filling Order Slips</h1>
    <p><em>Note, while this command is in the travel section you are able to use it while both travelling and stationary. This is due to a quirk in the IOLS protocols.</em></p>
    <p>Before you can offload an order, you must fill an order slip. This is the command:</p>
    
    <blockquote>/travel fillorder</blockquote>
    
    <p>For this you will need the following information:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Order ID</strong>. This is found in the original order.</li>
            <li><strong>Recipient Name</strong> found in Section 3. Spelling should be exact.</li>
            <li><strong>Address</strong> found in Section 3.</li>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>If either the address or recipent name is unknown or corroded, refer to Section 4.a</li>
            </ol>
            <li><strong>Ware</strong>. List out the ware the order demands as a single line of text, no capitals:
                <ol type="a">
                <li>Example: “shoes”</li>
                <li>Spaces are allowed if the ware is in multiple words.</li>
                <li>The orderslip requires the ware to be on the train. The porters will check for the ware and report if the orderslip ware is not present on the train.</li>
                <li>Note: The local customs agents depend on accurate reporting of wares on order slips.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    <p>If any information is filled incorrectly, this will incur a monetary penalty upon order offload. Refer to section 4.a if uncertain about recipient information.</p>
    
    <h3 id="-4-a-filling-orderslips-with-corroded-addresses-and-names-"><strong>4.a Filling Orderslips With Corroded or Unknown Information</strong></h3>
    <p>As noted in Section 3.1 you may have recipients whose address or name you cannot accurately determine. You may still fill an orderslip if this is the case.<br>
        Any information you cannot determine, you should manually mark as corroded by typing in the following without quotations in the appropriate fields:<br>
    ”<b>For Decorrosion Provider</b>” (must be exact) <br> </p>
    <p>Note that offloading orders for Decorrosion Providers will cost a small fee, yet this fee is much cheaper than filing wrong information. If you are in doubt about the veracity of information, a Decorrosion Provider is preferable to sending the ware to a wrong destination or recipient.</p>
    
    <h3 id="4-b-editing-orderslips">4.b Editing Orderslips</h3>
    <p>If needed you can use the following command to edit orderslips at any time when not at a station:</p>
    
    <blockquote>/travel editslip</blockquote>
    
    <p>This will open the command window for the order slip with the corresponding ID, and allow you to edit the data.</p>
