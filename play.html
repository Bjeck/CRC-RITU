    <h1 class="top">Welcome to the Remote Irregular Telegraph Unit</h1>

<p>By accepting this invitation you will become an Operator in the RIT Unit, the newest initiative from the Connective Rail Company.</p>

<p>You will manage freight on one of our existing Choir Trains, travelling across the Known World, yet while you remain entirely remote. <br>This is made possible through the Irregular Telegraph, which you will communicate through using a <s>Discord Server</s>.</p>

<p>[LINK SOON]</p>

<p>By accepting this invitation, you choose to work for the CRC under temporary contract. This may be terminated at any time. The CRC are not liable for any disturbances caused by the Telegraph while in use.</p>

<p>Once you are ready and have accepted the invitation, you will start the game using the following command:</p>

<blockquote>/startoperation</blockquote>

<p>This will let your superiors know you are reporting for duty. In order to prepare, you will be well served by familiarizing yourself with the <a href="./manual.html">manual</a>.</p>
