<h3>Manage freight through a telegraph wired to <s>frail</s> binary Gods.</h3>

<p>Telegrams from the Choir Train is an experimental narrative game running via a Discord Bot players invite into their own server.<br>
It is played in <b>real time</b>, with the train travelling to destinations over weeks.<br>
Players will manage buying and selling wares to fulfill orders at specific stations during this journey.
As they do this a story will unfold through letters and articles and diary entries. As they do they realize someone else is watching them.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Accept Orders, Buy Wares</h2>
<p>The world has been destroyed by a Logic Bomb, and can only be traversed by the sacred Choir Trains. It is your job to remotely make sure freight is transported across the world, by accepting orders, buying wares, and offloading them at the right place.</p>

<h2>Dig Through Corrupted Databases</h2>
<p>In order to correctly send your wares, you will need to determine the name and address of all recipients. This is made difficult due to the natural corrosion, a lingering effect of the digital corruption of the world, causing all written data to become innacurate over time. It is up to you to consult and cross reference multiple databases to find the correct information.</p>

<h2>Receive Telegrams</h2>
<p>As you do your job, the Telegraph will relay messages, both those intended for you and those intended for someone else. Or something else.</p>

<hr>

<h1>How To Play</h1>

<p>Play by following this <a href="./play.html">invitation</a>.</p>
<p>You will be able to play this game in any server. The game is best as a shared experience with a group of friends or like-minded people, who can trade tasks and discuss the story together. However, it can be played solo.</p>
<p>This is not a fast game. It is meant to be played in real time, over a long period of time. Be prepared to have the bot in your server and interact with it in small chunks over weeks and months.<br>
    Also note that the narrative is currently not complete. This is the first part of the story, playable on its own yet not with resolution for all threads.</p>

<h1>What is a "Choir Train?"</h1>
<p>
    The Choir Trains are sacred, all-important trains that connects our Known World. They are the only known vessel that can travel through <i>The Scan</i>, the digital corruption left all across the world after the Logic Bomb. They were granted to us by the Gods.
    The common name "Choir Train" is based on how people say they hear choral singing when the trains arrive. 
<br>
People say this, because recordings do not pick up anything resembling a choir.
