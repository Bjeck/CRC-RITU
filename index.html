<h3>Manage freight through a telegraph wired to <s>frail</s> binary Gods.</h3>

<p>Telegrams from the Choir Train is an experimental narrative game running via a Discord Bot players invite into their own server.<br>
It is played in <b>real time</b>, with the train travelling to destinations over weeks.<br>
Players will manage buying and selling wares to fulfill orders at specific stations during this journey.
As they do this a story will unfold through letters and articles and diary entries. As they do they realize someone else is watching them.</p>


<h1>How To Play</h1>
<p>The game is almost ready to be launched. When it is, a link will appear here to invite the discord bot into your own Discord server to start playing.<br>
You will be able to play this game in any server, at any time. It can be played solo yet is ideally a shared experience with a group of friends or like-minded people, who can trade tasks and discuss the story together.</p>

<p>To play, you will also need to consult the <a href="./manual.html">manual</a></p>

<h1>What is a "Choir Train?"</h1>
<p>
    The Choir Trains are sacred, all-important trains that connects our Known World. They are the only known vessel that can travel through <i>The Scan</i>, the digital corruption left all across the world after the Logic Bomb. They were granted to us by the Gods.
    The common name "Choir Train" is based on how people say they hear choral singing when the trains arrive. 
<br>
People say this, because recordings do not pick up anything resembling a choir.
