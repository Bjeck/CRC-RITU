<h1>Manual for Remote Operation of the Irregular Telegraph</h1>

<blockquote>This document is provided in collaboration with the Irregular Operations Line Service (IOLS) with permission under clause of the Remote Operation Act. Use for any other purpose is prohibited.</blockquote>

<p>For All Remote Operators of the Remote Irregular Telegraph (henceforth the RIT) (also known as the <i>“Stained Telegraph”</i>), this Manual will explain the basic functions and order of freight operations for all Choir Trains.</p>
<p>This manual walks through the operations:</p>
<ol>
    <li>accepting orders.</li>
    <li>buying wares.</li>
    <li>finding addresses of recipients.</li>
    <li>filing orders into order slips with the correct information.</li>
    <li>offloading wares at stations with the matching order slip.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    1, 2 and 5 can only be used while the train is <i>stationary</i>.
    
    3 and 4 can only be used while the train is <i>driving</i>.</p>
</p>

<h2>0. Status and Awareness</h2>
<h3>Seeing current information</h3>
<p>At all times you can inspect the status of your train with this command:</p>
<blockquote>/info</blockquote>
<p>See the current status and information of the train.<br>

    Includes information on current whereabouts and direction.<br>
    
    Refer to the [Atlas of the Known World](https://www.notion.so/Atlas-of-the-Known-World-62016ff131514dd9b6741cb0990c022b?pvs=21) to understand your location.</p>

<h3>Seeing the inventory</h3>
<p>At all times you can inspect the contents of the train with this command:</p>
<blockquote>/inventory</blockquote>
<p>Inventory is used to inspect your current inventory. Use this to know how much money you have at your disposal, as well as all wares purchased, and orders accepted.
<br>
    For responsible operation, you should always be mindful of the amount of money available. Overspending will reflect poorly on your stature.</p>

<h1 class="colored">STATIONARY</h1>
<p>The following commands are for use while the train is at a station.</p>

<h2>1. Accepting Orders</h2>
<p>Command:</p>
<blockquote>/station receive</blockquote>
<p>
    This command receives a random assortment of available orders at your station.

You will get three to choose from. <br>

Each order lists a <b>ware</b>, a <ib>recipient</b>, an <b>estimated cost</b>, a <b>reward</b> a <b>destination</b> and an <b>estimated database corrosion</b>.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <b>ware</b> is what they are asking for. You will need to acquire this and bring it to the customer. The stars (*) next to the name indicates the size of the ware.</li>
    <li>The <b>recipient</b> is listed with their Official UC ID. You will use this to find their personal information for offloading (See Section 3). A UC ID follows the format 123-456.</li>
    <li>The <b>reward</b> is how much money you will be paid once the order has been successfully completed.</li>
    <li>The <b>estimated cost</b> is an estimation based on the regular price of the way and the travel cost with this ware (accruing taxes and tariffs). Note this is an estimation and may be inaccurate. We trust you judge the efficacy of the order judiciously.</li>
    <li>The <b>destination</b> is the Precinct the order must be offloaded at. Consider this in relation to your current location when choosing. Further distances will require longer travel time (increasing expenditure of tariffs and taxes).</li>
    <li>The <b>Estimated DB Corrosion</b> is an estimation of the corrosion of the data for the recipient. Less corroded data will make the recipients information easier to ascertain. More corroded entries should be left to experienced Operators.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pick the most profitable and efficient based on your needs by pressing the appropriate of the three buttons.<br>
Remember you can see your available money, your current orders and wares with the inventory command. It may be valuable to inspect the price chart (Section 2.1) before you choose.</p>

<p><b>1.a Penalties Upon Failing to Receive Orders</b><br>

If you <b>cancel</b> the order reception procedure or <b>fail to pick</b> an order within <b>5 minutes</b> of requesting, you will be incurred a penalty, due to increased administration costs. We expect you to be able to accept an order when you request.
<br><br>
<b>1.b Penalties Upon Failing to Deliver Orders</b><br>

Keep in mind that failure to deliver an order will also accrue a severe penalty (and unhappy customers). We expect you to pick orders you are able to complete.</p>

<h2>2. Buying Wares</h2>
<blockquote>/station buy [ware] [amount]</blockquote>
<p>To fulfill orders you will need to buy the appropriate wares.<br>

    The buy command can buy any wares the current station has. Note, not all wares will be sold at all stations. Refer to the map.<br>
    
    A further command will help you here:</p>

<b>Seeing the Price chart</b>
<blockquote>/station pricechart</blockquote>
<p>Price chart is used to inspect the current purchase prices at this station. Use this to consider what wares to purchase and what orders to accept.<br>
    Ware prices might differ at each station. Be mindful of this when choosing orders to fulfill, as there is much to be gained from choosing your options wisely.<br>
    Refer to the [Atlas of the Known World](https://www.notion.so/Atlas-of-the-Known-World-62016ff131514dd9b6741cb0990c022b?pvs=21) for guidance of general pricing, although we are aware this does not provide complete information.</p>

<h1 class="coloredgreen">TRAVELLING</h1>
<p>The following commands are for use while the train is traveling.</p>

<h2>3. Finding Recipient Information</h2>
<p>To be able to fulfill the order, you will need to find <b>the home address</b> and <b>name</b> of the order recipient. This is required for completion of the order slip. <br>
    
    Every order contains a UC ID of the recipient that you will use as the starting point to find this information. Use the following command:</p>
<blockquote>/query database [entry to query] [database key] [public]</blockquote>
<p>Description of the arguments:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The “entry to query” must be exact to specifications. This is either the name of a person or an address.</li>
    <li>Database key is the name of the database. See below of possible databases.</li>
    <li>“Public” is whether the result should be visible to other fellow Operators. Defaults to False if not provided.</li>
</ul>

<p>Databases will likely return multiple possible results for any query. Existent database decomposition leaves individual databases incomplete and untrustworthy.<br>

    Thus, in most cases, you will need to use multiple databases to determine the exact address or name of any recipient. It is up to you to determine the best method for this.</p>

<p>The databases you have access to are below, listed by what type of data they accept.<br>
If you are unsure where to start, start with the “person” database and use the information in there to find the Name and the Home Address of the recipient.</p>

<h3>3.a Databases Accepting Person IDs</h3>
<ol>
    <li> Personal Register</li>
    <ol type="a">
        <li><i>The official UC Person Identification Database</i></li>
        <li>database key: <strong>"person"</strong></li>
        <li>Expects the ID of a person (An ID has the format 123-456). Outputs all known information about the person in the following order:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Name</li>
                <li>Job</li>
                <li>Work Address</li>
                <li>Home Address</li>
                <li>District</li>
            </ol>
        <li>These may have No Entry. Use this to inform your future queries. This database is kept clean and any corrupted entry is deleted. Thus if this database has information, you can consider it trustworthy.</li>
        <li>Note: You may be fortunate that this database includes both the name and the home address. In this case you will not need to consult any other databases and can proceed to Step 4.</li>

<p>Once you have determined the necessary information for an Orderslip with reasonable accuracy, you can move on to 4.</p>
<p><strong>3.1 Corrosion</strong> <br>
    It may be impossible to determine the name or address of a recipient in some difficult cases due to the natural database corrosion. If this happens, you may proceed and consult Step 4.b</p>

<p><strong>3.2 Threading</strong> <br>
    Any query provided in a channel will divert into a thread. This is for ease of use when using multiple queries to find the necessary information for one recipient. You may provide additional queries inside the thread, for organization.</p>
<p><strong>3.3 Vacancy</strong> <br>
Outside of being marked as empty in the Address information (see Section 3.c.1), an address can also be marked as vacant through its tenant being named “<strong>V. Vacant</strong>”. This is an legacy marking of Vacancy still used by the Estate Census. Any entry with this should be considered a vacant address at the time of reporting (yet of course, this may be corroded data and should be treated as no different than other information).</p>


<h2 id="4-filling-order-slips">4. Filling Order Slips</h2>
<p>With all information, you are able to fill an order slip. This is the command:</p>

<blockquote>/travel fillorder</blockquote>

<p>For this you will need the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Order ID. This is found in the original order.</li>
<li>Recipient Name found in Operation 3. Spelling should be exact.</li>
<li>Address found in Operation 3.</li>
<li>Ware. List out the ware the order demands as a single line of text, no capitals:<ol>
<li>Example: “shoes”</li>
<li>Spaces are allowed if the ware is in multiple words.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This command allows adding the information directly into the command for easier access. After typed in, it will open a command window for you to confirm the data.</p>
<h3 id="4-a-editing-orderslips">4.a Editing Orderslips</h3>
<p>If needed you can use the following command to edit orderslips at any time when not at a station:</p>

<blockquote>/travel editslip</blockquote>

<p>This will open the command window for the order slip with the corresponding ID, and allow you to edit the data.</p>

<h3 id="-4-b-filling-orderslips-with-corroded-addresses-and-names-"><strong>4.b Filling Orderslips With Corroded Addresses and Names</strong></h3>
<p>As noted in Section 3.b you may have recipients whose address you cannot accurately determine. You may still fulfill an orderslip if this is the case.<br>
    Any information you cannot determine, be it address or name, you may manually mark as corroded by typing in the following without quotations in the orderslip at the appropriate field:<br>
”<b>For Decorrosion Provider</b>” (must be exact) <br> </p>
<p>Note that offloading orders for Decorrosion Providers will cost a fee, yet this fee is cheaper than filing wrong information. If you are in doubt about the veracity of information, the Decorrosion Providers will be a less costly option than sending the ware to a wrong destination or recipient.</p>

<h1 class="colored">STATIONARY</h1>
<p>The following commands are for use while the train is at a station with a completed orderslip.</p>

<h1 id="5-offloading-wares">5. Offloading Wares</h1>
<p>Finally, once the order has been filled and is ready, you can offload the wares for the order at the appropriate station. 
This is done with the following command:</p>

<blockquote> /station offload_order [orderslip ID] [ware] </blockquote>

<p>Please refer to the order for the appropriate wares to offload.<br>Offloading wares requires an active order AND an orderslip to be filled out and present in your inventory, as well as the ware.<br>The orderslip ID is identical to the Order ID.</p>
