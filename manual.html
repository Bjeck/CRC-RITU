<h1 class="top">Manual for Remote Operation of the Irregular Telegraph</h1>

<blockquote>This document is provided in collaboration with the Irregular Operations Line Service (IOLS) under clause of the Remote Freight Operation Act. Use for any other purpose is prohibited.</blockquote>

<p>For All Remote Operators of the Remote Irregular Telegraph (henceforth the RIT) (also known as the <i>“Stained Telegraph”</i>), this Manual will explain the basic functions and order of freight operations for all Choir Trains.</p>


<h2>How to Use This Manual</h2>
<p>The Telegraph is designed to be used by multiple people, filling different roles for successful operation<br>
<i><br>The CRC notes that your allocated resources means you may have to work with fewer or more operators than this manual has been written for. We are confident you will make it work.</i>
   <br><br> These roles are covered in each section below:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="./manual_orders.html"><b>The Trader</b></a> (Sections 1 and 2): <a href="./manual_orders.html">Receiving orders and Buying Wares</a> </li>
        <ul>
            <li>This covers /receive, /buy, /sell, and /pricechart.</li>
        </ul>
    <li><a href="./manual_query.html"><b>The Investigator</b></a> (Sections 3 and 4): <a href="./manual_query.html">Querying information and filling order slips.</a></li>
        <ul>
            <li>This covers /query, /fillorder, and /editslip</li>
        </ul>
    <li><a href="./manual_offload.html"><b>The Manager</b></a> (Sections 5 and 6): <a href="./manual_offload.html">Offload wares at stations, upgrades and other advanced features.</a></li>
        <ul>
            <li>This covers /offload_order and /upgrade</li>
        </ul>
    <li><a href="./manual_archives.html"><b>The Reader</b></a>: <a href="./manual_archives.html">The <s>ARCHIVE</s></a></li>
    <ul>
        <li>This covers reading the Archive.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <li>The <s>Eye</s>: [REDACTED]</a></li>
    <ul>
        <li>This covers [REDACTED].</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<h2>Starting Operation</h2>
<p>If this is your first time as an operator, use the following command to get started:</p>
<blockquote>/startoperation</blockquote>

<h3>Seeing current information</h3>
<p>At all times you can inspect the status of your train with this command:</p>
<blockquote>/info</blockquote>
<p>See the current position and direction of the train.<br>    
    Refer to the <a href="./atlas.html">Atlas</a> to understand your location.</p>

<p>If you wish to be notified when the train arrives at or leaves a station, you can use the following command to setup a notification. This requires you to have made a role in the <s>Discord</s> you wish to use for notifications.</p>
<blockquote>/setuprole</blockquote>

<h3>Seeing the inventory</h3>
<p>At all times you can inspect the contents of the train with this command:</p>
<blockquote>/inventory</blockquote>
<p>Inventory is used to inspect your current inventory. Use this to know how much money you have at your disposal, as well as all wares purchased, and orders accepted.
<br>
    For responsible operation, you should always be mindful of the amount of money available. Overspending will reflect poorly on your stature.</p>


<h2>How To Execute an Operation</h2>

<p>
In order to successfully complete your orders, here is a guide to the processes required:
<ol>
    <li>(At a station) Receive an order. <a href="./manual_orders.html">/receive</a></li>
    <li>Buy the ware. <a href="./manual_orders.html">/buy</a></li>
    <li>(When train is travelling) Query databases for Recipient Information. <a href="./manual_query.html">/query</a></li>
    <li>Fill orderslips with said information. <a href="./manual_query.html">/fillorder</a></li>
    <li>(At correct station) Offload Ware and Orderslip. <a href="./manual_offload.html">/offload_order</a></li>
    <li>Repeat from step 1.</li>
    <li><a href="./manual_archives.html"><s>Read the Archive</s></a></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>We trust that these guidelines will be enough to execute proper operation of the Choir Train you have been set in charge of, Operator.<br>Best of luck.</p>
