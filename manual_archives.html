    <h1 class="top">Manual for Remote Operation of the Irregular Telegraph</h1>
    <blockquote>This document is provided in collaboration with the Irregular Operations Line Service (IOLS) under clause of the Remote Freight Operation Act. Use for any other purpose is prohibited.</blockquote>

    <h1 class="coloredpurple">[THE] <s>ARCHIVE</s> - READING</h1>
    <p>This document covers how to use the IOLS Archive.</p>

<p>The Telegraph has also been equipped with an archival feature. See the following super-command and its sub-commands:</p>

<blockquote>/archive</blockquote>

<p>All messages sent to you will be present in the Archive through the following command:</p>

<blockquote>/archive read [entry]</blockquote>

<p>The IOLS has advised that the Irregular Telegraph is experimental and can function unexpectedly. The Telegraph may receive messages sent by sources outside the CRC, which are not required for Freight Operation. The CRC or IOLS is not responsible nor legally bound by any such messages and they should be immediately discarded and ignored for your safety. Any such messages will be stored in the archive for future processing and inspection.
<br>Any suspicious activity seen on the Telegraph should be reported to your superiors.</p>

<p><i>...Several Pages have been omitted from this Document by the CRC...<br>Usage of the Archive is not required of Operators and is viewed as extracurricular activity and thus is not thoroughly explained within this document.<br>
    Excessive use is discouraged.</i></p>

<p>Other useful elements of the archive are the commands for the weekly newspaper and the CRC encyclopedia:</p>

<blockquote>/archive encyclopedia</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>/archive newspaper</blockquote>

<p>Use these as you wish.</p>
